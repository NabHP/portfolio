## Projects
**Model Machine Learning to Predict Used Car Price (June 21 – July 19, 2024)**
[Publication](https://github.com/NabHP/Capstone-3-_4_Machine-Learning-Model_Cloud_Computing)
This project takes on the task of guessing used car prices by creating a machine learning model in Python with Jupyter Notebook. By using data from syarah.com, model is trained to spot key factors that have an impact on used car prices. This helps people make smarter choices in the used car market giving buyers the power to find good deals and sellers the ability to price their cars. 
   
**Transjakarta Customer’s Behavior Analysis in Python (June 1 – June 6, 2024)**
[Publication](https://github.com/NabHP/Capstone_Module_2)
This project explores how Transjakarta customers use the service on weekdays versus weekends. By taking a close look at customer data using stats and charts, we want to spot clear trends in how people ride. What I learn can help make the service better, use resources, and give Transjakarta users a better experience overall.

**Correlation analysis between Movie’s Runtime and IMDB Score (May 21 – May 22, 2024)**
[Publication](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nabila.putri8636/viz/Netflix_analysis_17162577339100/main)
This project looks at how long movies and TV shows are compared to their IMDB scores using data from Netflix. I used Tableau to make pictures of the data that you can click on telling a story that shows patterns in the numbers. I want to figure out if how long something is affects how much people like it, based on IMDB ratings.

**Personal Library Management System in Python (April 12 – April 21, 2024)**
[Publication](https://github.com/NabHP/Capstone_Module1_Python)
This project aims to create a Python app that's easy to use and helps people manage their book collections. The app provides a simple way to input and store info about books making it a breeze for users to organize their libraries. With this tool, book lovers can keep tabs on what they own, find new books to read, and get more out of their reading hobby.
